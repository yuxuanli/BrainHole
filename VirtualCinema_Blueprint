#Virtual Cinema

One possible App.

This is a virtual cinema that allows the client to open a new room and invite people to enjoy video or audio simultaneously.

This is actually an online media player. The core function is to make multiple people share the same moment of the media. If any of the audiance need to leave for a seconds, he or she should have the control to stop the media and hold the other guys for a minute. If the other guy do not want to wait anymore, they are able to play it without waiting more. In this process, they may talk about the media using barrage over the screen like they sit next to each other in the cinema. Even they may let there camera open and can see each other through subscreens.

This is not intended to be a content provider, so it need to apply the API of media websites and should cover most channels in this wolrd, such as YouTube, Youku, bilibili, etc.

I believe this would be a fancy form of online activity. People may feel more intimate and become more talktive when share things together. And also this is a fantastic opportunity to know new friends with the same interest.

This is the blue-print, there are a lot of things such as the actual limit number of poeple in the same room, the hiearchy of contral in the same room, or how to avoid illegal content playing secretly... 

If you have any fresh idea and are willing to share with me, please go ahead.
